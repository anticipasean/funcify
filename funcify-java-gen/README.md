# funcify-java-gen

## Purpose

* Generate a _functional type system_ for use in composing Java classes, interfaces, enums, and more that:
    * adheres to and leverages features common in the algebraic data types in functional programming languages
    * does not use of terminology i.e. _applicative endofunctor_ that would likely require most of your colleagues to look up if they're not
      intimately familiar with category theory
    * follows the same naming conventions for packages, type names, function names, and parameters across all types
